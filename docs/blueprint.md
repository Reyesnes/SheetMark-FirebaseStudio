# **App Name**: SheetMark

## Core Features:

- Paste Data: Input data by pasting spreadsheet data directly into a textarea.
- Upload File: Upload spreadsheet data from a file (CSV, XLSX).
- Convert to Markdown: A one-click button to trigger the conversion process. After spreadsheet content is supplied, transform that content to markdown automatically. Use an LLM tool to reason whether column headers are present, and if so bold the markdown for that row.
- Markdown Preview: Display the resulting Markdown table in a read-only textarea.
- Copy to Clipboard: Copy the generated Markdown output to the clipboard with a single click.
- Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark mode for user interface preference.
- "Buy Me a Coffee" Button: A button with a link to a service like 'Buy Me a Coffee' to allow users to support the project.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted green (#8FBC8F) to evoke a sense of calmness and reliability, drawing from the association of green with spreadsheets.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop in light mode; Dark gray (#333333) for dark mode.
- Accent color: A more saturated forest green (#228B22) for interactive elements like buttons and links, creating a clear visual call to action.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, known for its readability and modern appearance. Its clean design helps ensure legibility, which is vital for presenting spreadsheet-derived data clearly.
- Use a clear, sectioned layout with generous spacing to enhance readability. Sections are divided with very light borders.
- Employ a set of consistent and professional icons to represent actions like uploading, copying, and converting. These icons should be simple and intuitive, following a minimalist design approach.
- Introduce subtle transitions and animations, like a gentle fade-in on the Markdown output or a smooth color transition on button hover states. Aim to make the user interface feel polished without being distracting.
